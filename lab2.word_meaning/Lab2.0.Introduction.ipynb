    "WordNet is a semantic lexical database that can be seen as a proxy for the words of the English languages with their meanings defined through lexical semantic relations. Wordnets have been built for many other languages, mostly by translating the words from English to this language and copying the meanings over (the so-called expand method). Wordnets can be used to calculate the similarity of word pairs through different techniques. You are going to explore these techniques in this notebook.\n",

    "Word embeddings are vector representations that are derived from large volumes of text. Each word in these corpora is represented through a vector which represents the weights of a hidden layer in  a neural network that learned to predict the context of words. Word embeddings are a powerful resource that can be learned withour supervision from text. Whereas wordnets have been built manually on the basis of human intuition, embeddings are derived empirically. It is still to be seen what yeilds better results: human intuition or particular sampling of empirical data.\n",
